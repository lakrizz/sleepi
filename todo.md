# todo
- frontend, duh
- all configuration
- figure out how to mimic cronjobs efficiently
- logging


# refactorings
- put the volume changing in its own file
- see if putting the base of the volume effect to 1 leads to a static growth

# thinkings
- implement some error when two planned alarms are overlapping? or just overwrite the "first" alarm?


# useful links, probably
- cronjob library for go: github.com/robfig/cron
